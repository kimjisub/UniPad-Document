## **Name** structure of LED event file.

| chain | x   | y   | Repetition | Order character |
| ----- | --- | --- | ---------- | --------------- |
| 1     | 5   | 6   |            |                 |
| 3     | 8   | 8   | 0          |                 |
| 4     | 1   | 1   | 1          | a               |
| 4     | 1   | 1   | 1          | 01              |

### Note

- The number of iterations **can be omitted** and the default value is 1.
- When the number of repetitions is **0**, the LED is **repetitively played** while the button is **pressing**
- The order character is for **multimapping**, and **the number of repetitions** cannot be omitted to use **order character**.
- Order characters use **English characters** or **numbered numbers with the same number of digits**.

```text title="Possible example 1"
1 4 2 1 a
1 4 2 1 b
```

```text title="Possible example 2"
1 7 3 1 01
1 7 3 1 02
...
1 7 3 1 09
1 7 3 1 10
```

```text title="Impossible example"
1 7 3 1 1
1 7 3 1 2
...
1 7 3 1 9
1 7 3 1 10
```

## The structure of the LED event **file**

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="on" label="on" default>

Turn on the LED to the (x, y) coordinates in **color code** and send **bellocity** to the lunch pad. If **color code** is **auto**, **color code** is automatically determined. Lunchpad S and mini models express similar colors. If x is \*, you can specify the color of the chain button on the launchpad. (1~32)

| on  | x   | y   | Color code | Velocity |
| --- | --- | --- | ---------- | -------- |
| on  | 3   | 4   | FFA726     | ‚Äã        |
| on  | 3   | 4   | 2196F3     | 45       |
| on  | 3   | 4   | auto       | 29       |
| on  | \*  | 32  | auto       | 15       |
| o   | 3   | 4   | FFA726     | ‚Äã        |
| o   | 3   | 4   | 2196F3     | 45       |
| o   | 3   | 4   | a          | 29       |
| o   | \*  | 32  | a          | 15       |

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="off" label="off">

Turn off the LED.

| off | x   | y   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| off | 3   | 4   |
| off | \*  | 2   |
| f   | 3   | 4   |
| f   | \*  | 2   |

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="delay" label="delay">

Make **delay time** until the next event.

| delay | ms  |
| ----- | --- |
| delay | 120 |
| d     | 120 |

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

The Velocity value is to support **communication with the launch pad**.

**auto** mode is recommended instead of color code.

**LED** turned off elsewhere can only be turned off in that file.

If you want to turn it off from another file, you can overwrite **LED** of that coordinate and turn it off with the **off** command.

```text title="1 1 1"
o 1 1 a 45
```

```text title="1 1 2"
o 1 1 a 0
f 1 1
```
